                <p>Non-renewable energy sources, such as coal and oil, significantly contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The over-reliance on fossil fuels has led to issues like climate change, environmental degradation, and resource depletion. Transitioning to renewable energy sources is essential to reduce harmful impacts on our planet.</p>

                <h1>Growing Energy Needs</h1>
                <p>Energy has always been closely linked to man's economic growth and development. Present strategies for development that have focused on rapid economic growth have used energy utilization as an index of economic development. The index, however, does not take into account the long-term effects on society of excessive energy utilization.</p>
                <p>For almost 200 years, coal was the primary energy source, fueling the industrial revolution in the 19th century. At the close of the 20th century, oil accounted for <strong>31.7%</strong> of the world's commercial energy consumption, followed by coal <strong>(26.5%)</strong> and natural gas <strong>(23.3%)</strong>, while nuclear <strong>(4.0%)</strong> and hydro/renewable <strong>(6.4%)</strong> accounted for the rest.</p>
                <p>Industrialization and urbanization and the unbelievable rise in human settlements have multiplied the energy requirement by several times. Modern lifestyle and man's growing dependence on machines and equipment for his personal and professional work has added to the energy demand. Global oil demand continues to grow until 2040, mostly because of the lack of easy alternatives to oil in road freight, aviation, and petrochemicals, according to WEO-2016, published by the International Energy Agency.</p>
